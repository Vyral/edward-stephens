<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are many ways a lease contract option can benefit you as a homebuyer.</em></p>

Have you ever considered using a lease-option contract to purchase a home?

First, let’s review what a lease-option contract is. Essentially, it’s a contract that comes in two parts: the lease and the option. The lease is something anyone who’s ever rented an apartment or a house is familiar with, but the option is what throws some people for a loop. 

Basically, the option is something you pay as an addition to your rent each month, and it ensures that you have the first right of refusal. In other words, you have the option to purchase the home during a specific time frame, the length of which is determined in the contract. More important than the anatomy of a lease option, though, is determining whether it’s a good idea for you if you’re looking to purchase a home. 

To that end, here are six benefits that come with purchasing a home through a lease option:

**1. Selection.** Anyone who’s looking for a home to rent right now knows there’s not a lot of corresponding inventory available in the Kansas City metro—you can find at least three times as many homes for sale as there are for rent on Zillow. With a lease option, you can widen your selection and browse homes that are for sale as well as those that are available for rent. 

**2. You don’t have to save for a down payment or closing costs.** With a lease option, all you have to do is sign a lease and have your security deposit and your first month’s rent. This is perfect if you’re still building up your savings account. You can move into the home you want and buy it later on down the line.

**3. You can wait for a lower interest rate.** If you believe interest rates will eventually decrease, you can use a lease option to rent the house and wait until they actually do decrease to buy it. That way, your monthly payment will be lower than what it was if you purchased it right now. 

**4. It gives you the option of “test driving” your home.** If you’re new to the Kansas City metro or you’re not sure where you want to end up but you’ve found a home you’re comfortable living in, a lease option gives you the flexibility to move quickly because you don’t have to worry about selling the home. All you have to do is end the lease and you can be on your way. 

**5. It protects you from real estate bubbles.** If you think real estate values are in a bubble, you don’t want to be one of those sellers who gets stuck trying to sell their home after the bubble bursts. If you purchase a home through a lease option, the bubble does burst, and you need to move, you can simply end your lease. 

**6. They have less restrictive credit requirements.** The credit requirements for a lease option are much less stringent than buying a home outright. If you think you have to wait until next year to buy a home because you have less-than-stellar credit, you can actually go shopping for the home of your dreams tomorrow with a lease option and build your credit until you can purchase the home outright.
