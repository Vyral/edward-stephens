<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how our market’s latest numbers affect you as a buyer or seller.</em></p>

Today we’ll be going over the latest numbers from **Johnson County’s real estate market.** Let’s begin by answering everyone’s biggest question: Are we in a buyer’s or seller’s market?

To find out, we look at our months of inventory or the amount of time it would take to sell all homes currently on the market without new ones being listed. **Johnson County has an extremely low 1.2 months’ worth of inventory**, which means we’re definitely in a seller’s market.

On average, the cost per square foot is $144, which has climbed from $139 in July 2018. **Homes are spending about 24 days on the market before they sell.** In May of 2018, this number was as low as seven, which means it takes about three times longer to sell a home during this time of year than it does during the peak selling season. For more reference, it took 82 days to sell a home back in the winter of 2011.

Our market is also impacted by interest rates, which are controlled by the Federal Reserve. **The rates are currently around 4.5%, which is historically low.** This means it’s easier and less expensive for people to buy homes. And since more buyers are out there buying homes, prices are going up to meet demand.&nbsp;
