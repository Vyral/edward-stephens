*When buying a home, due diligence is key. Here’s what you need to have.*

When purchasing my first home, I was terrified of buying a “lemon,” a clunker of a home that would start falling in on itself after I’d occupied it for only a short time.

I quickly learned the importance of doing proper due diligence, a step I find many people sadly tend to overlook. This ends up costing home buyers time and money in the long run.

During the due diligence process, there are a few important documents you need in order to ensure your home meets your expectations and requirements. Today we’ll be going over the things you’ll require, and we’ll also showcase a great tip you can use when buying real estate.

**The first crucial document is the Seller’s Disclosure report.** This report must be thoroughly filled out by the seller and given to the buyer for review. Do not skim this report; as a buyer, your responsibility is to read and understand the document to its fullest extent before moving forward with the process.

The second report to familiarize yourself with is a **home inspection report.** I recommend hiring a home inspector to create a lengthy report on the current conditions of the house. Don’t be afraid to interview the inspector for more details, which can help you to gain a thorough understanding of the property’s needs and priorities.

Next is the title report. **It’s important to make sure the title you’re working with is clean and free of any defects.** Many buyer’s agents will complete this step of the process for you, though it’s still advisable to read and understand this report for yourself. You’d hate to move into the house only to run into an ownership dispute shortly thereafter.

The fourth document is the often-overlooked **report of homeowners association covenants and restrictions.** It’s useful to understand how much freedom you’ll have when it comes to personalizing and customizing your house as you see fit.

These are just four of what I consider the eight critical documents to familiarize yourself with before finalizing the purchase of your next home.

Now, let’s talk about why many home buyers fail to diagnose these problems before deciding to close on the house.

First, many people accept the MLS listing at face value, trusting that the professionals involved in the process always know what they’re doing. Unfortunately this isn’t always the case, and **the details on the MLS sheet need to be verified to make sure you’re getting exactly what you paid for.**

Second, moving is challenging. The last thing you feel you need is to get further bogged down in the buying process, adding to your already considerable time investment. Moreover, since many of these steps are not required, it can be very tempting to skip them entirely.

The last reason people fail to do proper due diligence is because they mistakenly believe they have legal recourse in the event of a worst case scenario. That’s not always the case, so make sure you know everything upfront to avoid relying an often unpredictable justice system to fix the situation.

One last tip I want to provide is something most people never think of: talk to the neighbors. It may seem intimidating, but it’s a simple way to get an unfiltered, honest assessment of potential problems with a home.

The period before closing on a home is an incredibly important time for you as a buyer, so make sure you don’t fall victim to being lazy down this home stretch.
